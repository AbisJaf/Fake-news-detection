Fake News Detection with Machine Learning
This project tackles the critical issue of fake news detection by developing a machine learning model capable of classifying articles as either "true" or "fake." Leveraging a dataset of news articles, the solution employs a Logistic Regression model trained on text features to accurately identify misinformation.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Implemented a robust text preprocessing pipeline including lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, and stop word elimination to prepare textual data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Combined title, text, and subject fields into a comprehensive training_feature for richer model input.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform raw text into numerical feature vectors, capturing the importance of words within the dataset.
Model Training & Evaluation: Trained a Logistic Regression model and evaluated its performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion Matrix Visualization: Generated and visualized confusion matrices to provide clear insights into the model's predictive performance, distinguishing between true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
This project demonstrates a practical application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning for combating the spread of misinformation, highlighting the importance of data-driven approaches in today's digital landscape.
